Our Experiment:
During this project, we pass a "move" variable to many of our methods. Originally, our move 
variable simply represented the column that the move would be made in. While working on the project
we found that there were several different times where methods would have to iterate through a for-loop
to determine the row of each column that the move would actually be taking place in. Shortly after
that, we realized that it would also be useful to have a variable to denote whether it was 
our turn or the opponents. In order to solve both of these problems at once, we created a new 
class to hold information about the move. The new class contained a value for the column and row of 
the move as well as which player was executing the move. Using the class meant that rather than 
executing clunky code in each method, all we had to do was pull the value and save it to a variable.
